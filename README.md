# portfolio-v-2
 My second version of my portfolio. I wanted to build something outside of react. I had no previous experience with Alpine or halfmoon before this. Everything was built using only help from the documentation pages of each tool respectively.

 ## Tools used
  * Alpine.js
  * Express.js
  * Halfmoon 
  * Fontawesome

  I also used nodmon and prettier for dev tools.

  ## Features
  This project is mobile responsive, supports dark and light mode,  is SEO compliant, and is all in a single .html file.

__Simply type `npm run dev` in the console and go to local host 3000 to see it in action__
